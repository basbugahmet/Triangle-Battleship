The Triangle Battleship Game is a one-player game where the user creates a triangle battleship, calculating geometrical properties of the ship and surviving from a random shot. If the ship survives, the player gets a point which is the area of the ship.


## Project Features

-   The game starts with a menu which includes five options: (i) entering ship location (ii) listing the properties of the ship, (iii) shooting at the ship, (iv) showing high score table, and (v) exit.
-   The shape of the ship is a triangle and it can only be placed in the first quadrant (x>0, y>0) of the Cartesian coordinate plane. The player will enter the coordinates of three vertices (named A, B, and C) of the triangle. The program should control the validity of the triangle.
-   The game area is 30 * 12 units. The ship will be shown on the coordinate plane.
-   The program should list the following properties about the battleship:
    -   Basic Properties:
        -   The size of the ship (length of the edges)
        -   The perimeter of the ship
        -   The area of the ship
        -   The angles of the ship
        -   Median points of the ship (intersection of a median and a triangle edge)
        -   The centroid of the ship
    -   Advanced Properties:
        -   The length of the bisector of the point A
        -   The area of the inscribed and circumscribed circles
        -   The type of the ship:
            -   Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene
            -   Acute-angled, Right-angled, Obtuse-angled
-   It will be a random shot. If it hits the ship, the ship sinks.
-   If the ship survives, the player will get the point which is the area of the ship.
-   At the end of the game, the program should print the high score table. If the player gets a score that is high enough to be on the table, the name of the player is entered and his/her score is shown on the table. If the player gets a score that is equal to a score in the table, the name of the player is placed under the old one.
